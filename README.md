Optimization of Solar PV or Bioenergy Systems for Industrial Decarbonization
Project Overview

This project models, simulates, and optimizes solar PV or bioenergy deployment in industrial settings to:

Maximize renewable energy generation

Reduce reliance on the grid

Minimize carbon emissions

Ensure cost-efficiency

It demonstrates hands-on skills in renewable energy modeling, sustainability analytics, and industrial decarbonization, relevant to large-scale industrial projects such as Reliance’s New Energy and Bioenergy initiatives.

Key Features

Simulated Industrial Energy Demand: Realistic daily energy consumption for one year

Energy Generation Modeling: Calculates daily output based on solar irradiance or biomass availability

Carbon Reduction Estimation: CO₂ emissions avoided by renewable energy deployment

Optimization: Finds optimal PV or bioenergy system capacity to meet ≥90% energy demand

Interactive Visualizations: Plots showing energy demand vs. generation, carbon reduction, net demand, and cumulative emissions

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, plotly

Deployment (Optional): Streamlit for interactive dashboards
